  description: <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL
    Server</fullname> <p> Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and
    SQL Server is a service that helps you detect common problems with your .NET
    and SQL Server-based applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of
    issues in your applications (built with technologies such as Microsoft IIS,
    .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into detected
    problems.</p> <p>After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application
    Insights for .NET and SQL Server identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics
    and logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for
    unusual behavior to surface actionable problems with your application. For
    example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP
    500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights
    informs you that a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server database is
    occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors. </p>

          A <i>tag</i> is a label that you optionally define and associate with
          an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in
          different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other
          criteria.</p> <p>Each tag consists of a required <i>tag key</i> and an
          associated <i>tag value</i>, both of which you define. A tag key is a
          general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A
          tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain
          as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256
          characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white
          space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following
          additional restrictions apply to tags:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tag keys and
          values are case sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each associated
          resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one
          value.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>aws:</code> prefix is reserved for
          use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you
          define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that
          use this prefix. </p> </li> </ul>"
