     * @param p_sic - Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code Filter.  Enter a single 4-digit SIC Code to filter results.  If more complex filtering is required, use p_sic2 and p_sic4.
     * @param p_ncs - North American Industry Classification System Filter. Enter two to six digits to filter results to facilities having matching NAICS codes.  Digits less than six will match to all codes beginning with the provided values.
     * @param p_qnc - Number of quarters in non-compliance limiter.  Enter an integer value between 1 and 4 to limit results.
     * @param p_pen - Last Penality Date Qualifier Filter.  Enter one of the following:
     * - NEVER = No Penalties
     * - ANY = Any Penalty
     * - LEXX = Less than or equal to XX months.  Provide a number in place of XX, e.g. "LE5" for a facility with a penalty within previous 5 months.
     * - GTXX = Greater than XX months.  Provide a number in place of XX, eg. GT12, for a facility with the last penalty greater than 12 months ago.
     * @param p_opst - Operating status filter.  Enter one or more operating status codes to limit results.   Provide multiple codes as a comma-delimited list.
     * @param p_c1lat - In decimal degrees.  Latitude of 1st corner of box that bounds the resulting facilities. The latitude and longitude of both corners of the bounding box must be provided.

     * @param p_sic2 - Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code Filter Alternate 2. Enter a wild-card search against SIC codes.  A final wild-card is always present allowing "22" to match all SIC codes beginning with 22.  Use the "%" character within strings to match any SIC values with the pattern.  For example, "2%21" matches 2021, 2121, 2221, etc.
     * @param p_sic4 - Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code Filter Alternate 3.  Enter the first 2, 3 or 4 SIC code digits to filter results to facilities having those code prefixes.  As this alternative does not utilize an index, p_sic2 will generally be quicker.
     * @param p_fa - Federal Agency. 1 character or 5-character values; may contain multiple comma-separated values. ALL will retrieve all facilities where the federal agency code is not null.  Use the Federal Agencies lookup service to obtain a list of values.
