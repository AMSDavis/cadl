# ADL

ADL is a language for describing cloud service APIs and generating other API
description languages, client and service code, documentation, and other assets.
ADL provides highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API
shapes common among REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols.

You can try a work-in-progress build of the compiler by following the steps in
the Getting Started section below. Please feel free to [file
issues](https://github.com/Azure/adl/issues) for any issues you encounter while
using the preview.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js 14 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and ensure you are able to run the `npm` command in a command prompt:

   ```
   npm --version
   ```

2. Create a folder for your new ADL project

3. In a command prompt, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd path\to\adl\project
   npm init -y
   npm install -g @azure-tools/adl
   npm install @azure-tools/adl-rest @azure-tools/adl-openapi @azure-tools/adl-rpaas
   ```

   This will create a `package.json` file for your ADL project and add the necessary ADL dependencies to it.

4. Install the ADL extension for your editor of choice:

   - [Instructions for Visual Studio](#installing-visual-studio-extension)
   - [Instructions for Visual Studio Code](#installing-vs-code-extension)

5. Open the folder in your editor and create a new file with a `.adl` extension

6. [Follow our tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) to get started writing ADL!

7. Once you're ready to compile your ADL to Swagger, save the file and type this at the command prompt in your project folder:

   ```
   npx adl compile .
   ```

   This will compile the ADL files in the project folder into one output file: `.\adl-output\openapi.json`.

You can also check out a variety of samples in the [adl-samples](packages/adl-samples/) folder.

## Usage

See full usage documentation by typing:

```
adl --help
```

You can launch ADL in one of two ways:

### Compiling a folder of ADL files to an OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) specification

You can compile a folder containing `.adl` files into a single OpenAPI document by
using the following command:

```
adl compile samples/petstore/
```

You can now examine the emitted OpenAPI document in `./adl-output/openapi.json`.

### Generating a TypeScript client from a folder of ADL files

You can compile a folder containing `.adl` files into a single OpenAPI document by
using the following command:

```
adl generate --client samples/petstore/
```

Parameters for generating clients in other languages will be added soon.

### Formatting adl files

ADL provides an auto-formatter to keep your specs clean and organized.

```bash
adl format <patterns...>

# Format all the files in the current directly with the adl extension.
adl format **/*.adl
```

### Installing VS Code Extension

```
adl code install
```

This will download and install the latest VS Code extension. Use `adl code uninstall` to remove it. Pass `--insiders` if you use VS Code Insiders edition.

If `adl-server` cannot be found on PATH by VS Code in your setup, you can
configure its location in VS Code settings. Search for "ADL" in File ->
Preferences -> Settings, and adjust `adl.adl-server.path` accordingly. You may
need to restart VS Code after changing this.

You can also configure a project to use a local npm install of
`@azure-tools/adl`. See [local-adl sample](packages/adl/samples/local-adl).

### Installing Visual Studio Extension

```
adl vs install
```

This will download and install the latest Visual Studio extension. Use `adl vs uninstall` to remove it.
